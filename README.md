TODO: b2 (ASAP):
- set up iOS testflight / certificates etc.
- (sporadically) Get/set ratings sometimes turns into an infinite loopâ€¦? Old version data issue?
- insta scroll to mile (on map) when tracking is active (now it always attempts to center user)
- PCT towns, clickable on map
- (wip) Android: keyboard issues (overlay form)
<br/><br/>
TODO v1:
- (wip) add: PCT towns (+info and link towns to nearest trail road/trail junction)
- (wip) add points of interest (or notes) that belong to a town instead of the trail (when near town)
- add: compass heading, all cordova plugins seem to have android issues, iOS only?
- add: purchase routines (app store / google play)
- add: export personal notes (as csv?)
- add: backup notes based on userID (firecloud)
<br/><br/>
- fix: improve elevation profile scrollbar accuracy
- fix: back and forth between elevation profile and mile detail page results in change of current mile (scroll issue)
- fix: different contrast settings for online/offline maps.
- fix: downloader state (has downloaded file, but there's an update available)
- fix: optimising (virtual list rendering), can/should be smoother
- fix: end of trail scrolling (last 2 mile never visible on map)

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 7.1.2.

## Development server

<b>ng build</b> > <b>cd mobile</b> > <b>cordova build android</b> (might have to add platform first (<b>cordova platform add</b>))

or

<b>ng serve</b>, run in chrome. Unzipping will be disabled so offline maps wont work, and window resizing is buggy (SVG redraw, not needed for mobile), it's even more limited in Safari.

## Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI README](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/README.md).
